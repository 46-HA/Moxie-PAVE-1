Moxie-PAVE-1

What we’re detecting:
- CO2 Leaks
- Allergens in the air (Mold, pet dander, things found in the spring time, such as pollen)
- VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds)
- Particulate Matter
- Radon
- Etc

Moxie’s preventions:
- Liver and kidney damage (VOCs)
- Central nervous system damage (VOCs)
- Lung cancer (Particulate matter)
- Asphyxiation (CO2 leaks)
- Cardiovascular disease (Particulate matter)
- Chronic Bronchitis (Particulate matter)
- Increased cancer risk (Radon and VOCs)
- Respiratory irritation (VOCs, particulate matter, and radon)
- Asthma (Allergens and particulate matter)
- Headaches, drowsiness, etc (CO2 leaks)

People at risk:

CO2
- Poorly ventilated places (think schools, offices, basements)
- Infants and elderly (more sensitive to oxygen deprivation)
- People with heart or lung condition
- Low-income households (older houses tend to have worse ventilation or no CO2 monitors)

Allergens
- Children younger adults (likely to develop asthma)
- People w/ allergies or asthma
- High pollen areas

VOCs
- Elderly and children/infants (higher risk of disease)
- Pregnant women (developmental effects in fetuses)
- New homes (exposure to paint/new things) 
- Low-income renters/homes (more VOC-emitting materials)

Particulate Matter
- Elderly people and children/infants
- People with pre-existing diseases/symptoms such as asthma, COPD, or heart disease 
- Urban residents (more exposure from traffic, industry, smoke, etc
- Low-income neighborhoods
- Outdoor workers 

Radon
- Radon-prone regions
- People who live in basements
- Long-term residents (risk builds with exposure time)
- Smokers

Primary groups:
- Children/Infants
- Elderly
- Low-income families
- Urban/Rural/Suburban
- People with pre-existing symptoms (asthma, COPD, etc)
- Smokers
- Workers in certain jobs
